The files in this directory were copied from a repository of JS seeded RNG implementations. Per licensure requirements I'm including a copy of that license here. Thanks to the OSS folks who made these available https://github.com/dworthen/prng/blob/master/LICENSE.md. I've only taken the kiss07 algorithm and mash component.

The status of Xorshift03, KISS07 and LFIB4 is somewhat unclear. The sources are Usenet posts, and one of them explicitly states "You are welcome to use one or both of the above". It seems unlikely that Professor Marsaglia intended to restrict their use in any way, but on the other hand, I have no indication that he ever formally released them to the public domain.
